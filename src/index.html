                  <p>
                    One Down Looking Forward for Eleven More

                    The first week was a shock, I indeed entered a boot camp. Starting from the prep-work all throughout the rest of the week, all of us from the class had the taste of brain squeezing experience. I will have to admit that I had second thought of continuing this course go to my back-up plan.  Good thing, by Thursday or Friday, things that we were trying to learn made sense as a whole. We create things in Git, make a copy in our local computer, play with it and test it, bring back to Git.

                    In particular, these are the things we learned in a short span of one week:

                    * Github - we created repos in this wonderful version control system. From here we can share, fork our working files. We also learned how to sync my files to our local computer to work with the files and then push it back to Github again,

                    * Javascript - we learned the foundation this language, starting from the basic types of objects and manipulating these to form simple apps.

                    * Creating and Testing JS Files - we learned to test our JS files, using some codes in the terminal such as `node`, `mocha` and `chai`. These test frameworks had given me different perspective in testing my js apps other than the conventional console.

                    * Talk and Think like a developer - the first week gave me gave me the idea on what my life as Developer will be. Staring at codes the whole day. haha. Well I honestly enjoyed coding and I get excited when my expected outputs are starting to show up.

                    * The great growth Mindset - In relation to the hardships we had in the first week, It's great that the growth mindset was introduced to us. Applying this mindset reinforced us to survive and convert our wounds to battle scars. :sunglasses:

                    From the experience, I awaken my brain from someone who do normal 9-5  office mindset to a front end rising action hero. Looking forward for the next 11 weeks of challenges and fulfillment.
