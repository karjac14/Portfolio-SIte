# One Down Looking Forward for Eleven More 


The first week was a shock, I indeed entered a boot camp. Starting from the prep-work and the rest of the week, all of us from the class had the taste of brain squeezing experience. 

We learned:

* Git hub
* Javascript Object Types
* Creating and Testing JS Files
* Talk like a developer
* The growth Mindset

From the experience, I awaken my brain from someone who do normal 9-5 working office mindset to a Javascript rising action hero spirit.
