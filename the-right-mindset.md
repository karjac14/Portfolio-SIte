## Two Kinds of Mindset

Just like any athlete, whether a football player or a chess player, one has to train himself to beat his personal record every time. A good coach never tells his player that he was born a natural sportsperson. Both the athlete and the coach knows that they have to set their minds patterned to popular philosophy of - practice makes perfect. In learning, there are two kinds of mindsets, either you know you were born naturally great or you shed sweat to be great. The first one is called **_Fixed Mindset_**, it is the thinking that a person thinks he has a certain level of intelligence, either limiting or exaggerating it. While the latter mindset is the **_Growth Mindset_** which means a person never limits himself to improve through exerting effort and continuous practice.

I can say that I always had that fixed mindset. When I was young, my parents will of course naturally think I got my intelligence from them and will praise me :family:. Comparing myself with others who are struggling made me feel that I am superior (at least on that moment), while perhaps I try to ignore those who I think are doing better than me. While in some instances, I still apply the growth mindset when it comes to sports. This is where I can easily notice improvements every time I practice and testing my limits.

I am thankful that I had the chance to know the differences of the two mindsets. I even told my wife about it and she was amazed :ok_woman: with this philosophy. Embracing the idea of growth mindset will really help me understand the challenges and probably frustrations that I will face in this course. I also now understand why the instructors does not spoon feed us. I am not sure whether they are squeezing or expanding our brains. Either way, it is helping myself knowing that I can improve over time and will benefit me in my future thinking of myself.
