##Week 5

Hooaray! its week six now! (last week was week 5) I guess this is the stage where everyone in the class are fully understanding the weight of the immersion course. We dive in to assignments, we learn from it then repeat the process. Though its tiring, it feels fulfilling that we learn new things everyday and we are able to use this new set of knowledge as assignments are becoming complex.

In week 5, we learned about API, more of testing using Mocha and Chai, and the great MVC again.
