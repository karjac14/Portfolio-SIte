##Week 5

Hooaray! its week six now! (last week was week 5) I guess this is the stage where everyone in the class are fully understanding the weight of this immersion course. We dive in to assignments, we learn from it then repeat the process. Though its tiring, it feels fulfilling that we learn new things everyday and we are able to use these new set of knowledge as assignments are becoming complex.

In week 5, we learned about API, more of testing using Mocha and Chai, and the great MVC again.

API - we were introduced to the concept of API and it uses. I had hard time of grasping things about API and looking forward to learn it overtime through practice and experience.

Mocha & Chai - Again, these test frameworks were brought up again. I guess its time that we learn these two finally. From setting up the tests and implementing it in browser based (i.e. test.html)

MVC - The hardest chessboard that I ever played. It was great that going back to this project gave us more understanding of the MVC. Though I still have some questions and doubts about the starting point and data encapsulation.
