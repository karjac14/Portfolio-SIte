###Week 3

Week three was great, it has a lot of ups and downs. Monday was quite relaxed since most of the assignements were  yak-shaving. These researching stuffs are something that we should not underestimate as these will eventually help us later on as we do the actually coding. Tuesday and Wednesday activities were quite toxic for me as I tried to finish the assignments fully - because I didn't knew that the assignments are in chunks and are meant to be done till weekend. Thursday towards the weekend was a more of a revelation (so serious). I was able to apply the things I have learned from the previous days and was able to come up with much complete assignment. I also realized more the effectiveness of pair programming. This way of working teaches us how to work in a team and learning how others think. Eventually we can adopt the good side of everyone.

In particular, we learned the following in week three:

**CSS** - we learned a bunch about this language, like how it is integrated with the DOM and eventually to work around with it. This language (or files) make the web pages really more visually appealing.

**Selectors, Properties and Values** - while doing the assignments we explored different properties that we can use in enhancing the the DOM and reach our goal of having the correct layout.

**Skitching** - we practiced skitching or shall we say determining the elements that can be placed in a box. From there we can actually know where position the elements.

####Week 3

Week three was great, it has a lot of ups and downs. The first day was quite easy since we did plenty of yak-shaving. But it is something that we should not underestimate as these researching stuff will eventually help us later on as we do the actually coding. Tuesday and Wednesday were quite toxic for me as I tried to finish the assignments fully - not that I knew that last week's assignments are in chunks that are meant to be done till weekend. Thursday towards the weekend was a more of a revelation (so serious). I was able to apply the things I have learned from the previous days and was able to come up with much complete assignment. I also realized the effectiveness of pair programming. This way of working teaches us how to work in a team and learning how others think that we can eventually adopts the good side of it.

In particular, we learned the following in week three:

CSS - we learned a bunch in general about this language, like how it is integrated with the DOM and eventually to work around with it and make the web pages really more visually appealing. 

Selectors, Properties and Values - while doing the assignments we explored different properties that we can use in enhancing the the DOM and reach our goal of having the correct layout.

Skitching - we practiced skitching or shall we say determining the elements that can be placed in a box. From there we can actually know where position the elements.
