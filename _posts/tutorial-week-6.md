##Why even Bother to Bower

####What it is?

Bower is a tool, specifically a package manager for your web development needs. It helps in populating the packages we need specially in starting a project. As mentioned on the website:

_Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff youâ€™re looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, `bower.json`._


####What can we do with it?

As mentioned above we can install neccessary frameworks we need such as Angular, Lodash, Jquery, CSS files, and fonts.


####Installing Bower?

To install bower from your terminal:

`npm install -g bower`

To install packages:

`bower install <package>`

example: `bower install jquery`
