##Week 6

As always, tons of new knowledge were introduced last week. It's great to think that I am not surprise anymore, nor my classmates. We already learned to adopt to everyday activities and nightly assignments.

From last week, we learned creating html templates which we can incorporate the data from an API via Lodash. I would say that I am not yet comfortable in this area as we are yet to put this in more practice. On the second half of the week, we were assigned to work with a partner in creating four blueprints (web apps) that has several features. Through these assignments, I learned more on how to deal with other developers (claiming it!) in approaching issues and breaking down bigger projects. Through these blueprints we were able to get more comfortable with html, sass and Jquery.

I would say, as weeks goes by, I am becoming more efficient and effective in approaching the development tasks. In result, I am becoming more confident with these new skills, and very eager to improve them more.
