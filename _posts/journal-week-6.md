##Week 6

As always, tons of new knowledge were introduced last week. It's great to think that I am not surprise anymore, nor my classmates. We already learned to adopt to everyday activities and everynight assignments. 

From last week, we learned the creating html templates that we can incorporate data from an API via Lodash. I would say that I am not yet comfortable in this area as we are yet to put this in more practice. On the second half of the week, we were assigned to work with a partner in creating four blueprints (web apps) that has several features. Through these assignments, I learned more on how to deal with other developers (claim it!) in approaching issues and breaking down bigger projects. 

I would say, as weeks goes by, I am becoming more efficient and effective in approaching the development tasks. In result, I am becoming more confident with these new skills, and very eager to improve them more.
