Week 4 was tough, a lot of things were introduced such as SASS, semantic HTML and the concept of MVC. Jquery and test frameworks such as mocha and chai were re-introduced again. The asisgnments last week were I guess were too much, considering that we only have a single nights to do three of four webpages. 

We re-created the HTML of the blue prints and had learn doing it semantically by using the correct element tags, classes and ids. HTMLs were a little tidious to do but it is something that we actually need to experience doing as it is the DOM where all other files are linked.

I find doing the CSS thru Sass is really more convenient than just doing conventional css. Splitting my screen showing the html in one side and the scss on the other gives me a better way of easily referring the selectors that to be used and which proerties to be assigned. We can actually use the DOM tree as a guide to make the nested  stucture of the Sass.

Jquery was very useful in last week's tasks. The jquery replaces and even improves what the traditional javascript can do. So far we've been using this library to listen to events and alter the classes of the DOM elements.

We also learned the concept of MVC (Model View Controller), we incorporated all the skills we have learn in html, CSS/SASS and JS/Jquery to construct a more complex MVC.  I look forward that that the whole class will have beter grasp in MVC in general.
