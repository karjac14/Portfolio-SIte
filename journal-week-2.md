##Two Weeks

Last week, we learned:

**More of Githubbing** - more exposure in terminal, solving conflicts. Using source tree as alternative.

**Understanding JS** - continued improving our skills in JS by applying it to morr practical ways. i.e. linking it with html.

**More testing of JS via node and browser** - we further learned testing our JS files with node and frameworks such as mocha and chai. We also started accessing html, css and JS files in the browser.
